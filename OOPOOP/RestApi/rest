REST
Rest stands for representational state transfer
It is an architecture style which defines a set of protocols of how an api is writtten
It follows a set of principles for the design and the development of an api.

It is very efficient technology as REST takes less bandwidth over other similar technologies.

Principles or REST APIs
Client - servers - 
Stateless - meaning states can be independent of one another
Cacheable - A rest api should be able to hold a cacheable data.
Uniform interface - there should be a uniform interface across all devices for interaction between client and server. 
Layered system - Includes several layers that interact together - helping in scalability.

Rest uses HTTP methods to perform crud operations.. Post ia used to create, Get is used to read, put is used to update and  delete to delete data.
